The main routines for tree.js and vines.js are, respectively, DRAWING.drawTree() and DRAWING.drawVines(). 

The routines take the following parameters: 

	DRAWING.drawTree()
		context -- HTML Canvas 2D context
		start -- Object of the form {'x': NUMBER, 'y': NUMBER}
		totalEnergy -- The amount of energy for growing available to the whole tree.	
			
	DRAWING.drawVines()
		context -- HTML Canvas 2D context
		start -- Object of the form {'x': NUMBER, 'y': NUMBER}
		angle -- Direction of growth of initial branch
		depth -- Distance to grow (also affects the width of the branches)
		alpha -- Starting alpha transparency
		decay -- rate at which branches turn transparent
		
		
As an example, the following script randomly calls one of the routines and places it in a canvas object:
